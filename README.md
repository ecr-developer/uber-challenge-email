# Email Microservice - Uber Code Challenge for back-end

The aim of this project is to demonstrate a solution to the challenge posed to professionals who apply for Uber's open opportunities.

- [Uber coding challenge](https://github.com/uber-archive/coding-challenge-tools/blob/master/README.md) / [Guidelines](https://github.com/uber-archive/coding-challenge-tools/blob/master/coding_challenge.md)

Of the 4 challenges, I chose the **Email Service** focused on the back-end.

## Comments

- The challenge is not currently used, I am doing it to contribute to the development of your learning or as a possible reference;
- My solution is not the only one, there are several ways of doing it and the best one is the one you propose to do, you just have to apply the best practices on the market;
- My goal is to try to transfer the knowledge or skills that the market normally requires of a back-end engineer;
