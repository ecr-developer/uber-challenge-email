The aim of this project is to demonstrate a solution to the challenge posed to professionals who apply for Uber's open opportunities.

Of the 4 challenges, I chose the **Email Service** focused on the back-end.

## Comments

- The challenge is not currently used, I am doing it to contribute to the development of your learning or as a possible reference;
- It will serve as practice for me, in frameworks that I've used little and wanted to experiment more with, and to use the new features of Java version 17;
- My solution is not the only one, there are several ways of doing it and the best one is the one you propose to do, you just have to apply the best practices on the market;
